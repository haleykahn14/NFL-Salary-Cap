# NFL-Salary-Cap
Project in Data Centric AI

This project was created for my class CS 3291: Projects in Data Centric AI. It focuses on analyzing NFL data such as player salaries, annual team win percents, historical win data, salary cap, pay by position group, etc.. The main goal of the project is to find an optimal way for NFL teams to spend their salary cap money across the field.
